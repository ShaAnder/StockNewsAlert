    "function": "TIME_SERIES_DAILY",

#we want to use list comprehension to make this easier to read and pull data from
data_list = [value for (key, value) in data.items()]

#we need to compare yesterdays data to the day before yesterdays data we can get these by:
y = data_list[0]

#we now get the closing price by grabbing the value from the close key, we round it to 2 and float it as decimal
y_closing_price = round(float(y["4. close"]),2)
#we can now do the same and get the day before yesterdays prices
dby = data_list[1]
dby_closing_price = round(float(dby["4. close"]),2)
#now we can get the difference, we want to use an absolute function so it doesn't give us a negative number
difference = abs(y_closing_price - dby_closing_price)
#using an if statement we can give a visual indication of positive/ negative stock fluctuations
fluctuation = None

#if the fluctuation is above 0 that means stock went up else it went down
if difference > 0:
    fluctuation = "ðŸ”º"
else: 
    fluctuation = "ðŸ”»"

#we also want % difference for our if statement

# ### --- GET THE NEWS --- ### 

#if the % difference is above 5% we want to  get the news articles for that particular company
